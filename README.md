# doom-speedrun-analysis

An incomplete set of tools for extracting data from Classic Doom speedruns.

# Usage

Run `./pull-data.sh movie` where `movie` is a recording of a Classic Doom speedrun made with OCR.wad. A file named `data.csv` will be output to the script directory.

# Requirements

Just `bash` and `imagemagick` until the Jupyter notebooks are added. You can even use the bash environment on Windows 10.
